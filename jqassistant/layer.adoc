== Layer

This chapter describes the concepts and constraints related to the layered package structure of the application.

=== Concepts

[[layer:Layer]]
.The application has a layered structure. Each layer is represented by a package located in the root package and labeled as `Layer`.

[[layer:LayerDependency]]
[source,cypher,role=concept,requiresConcepts="layer:Layer",reportType="csv"]
.A dependency between two layers exists if there are dependencies between Java types in any of the sub-packages. These are represented by `DEPENDS_ON` relations.
----
MATCH

  (layer2:Layer:Package)-[:CONTAINS*]->(type2:Type),

RETURN
  layer1 as Dependent, layer2 as Dependency, weight as Weight

[[layer:LayerDependencyDefinition]]
[plantuml,layerdeps,role=concept,requiresConcepts="layer:Layer"]
.The dependencies between layers are represented by `DEFINES_DEPENDENCY` relations.

=== Constraints

[[layer:LayerDependencyViolation]]
[source,cypher,role=constraint,requiresConcepts="layer:LayerDependency,layer:LayerDependencyDefinition",primaryReportColumn="Type"]
.There must be no dependencies between layers that are not explicitly defined.
----
MATCH
  (layer1:Layer)-[:DEPENDS_ON]->(layer2:Layer)
WHERE NOT
  (layer1)-[:DEFINES_DEPENDENCY]->(layer2)

=== Reports

[[layer:LayerDependencyDiagram]]
[source,cypher,role=concept,requiresConcepts="layer:LayerDependency",reportType="plantuml-component-diagram"]
.Diagram about existing dependencies between layers.
----
MATCH

RETURN

----

[[layer:LayerDependency.graphml]]
[source,cypher,role=concept,requiresConcepts="layer:LayerDependency",reportType="graphml"]
.GraphML report about dependencies between layers and their contained types.
----
MATCH
  (layer:Layer:Package)-[:CONTAINS*]->(type:Type)
OPTIONAL MATCH
  (type)-[dependsOn:DEPENDS_ON]->(:Type)
RETURN {
